- ### Machine Learning
	 - üéì [Supervised Learning: Analysis of Graduate Admissions Machine Learning Models:](https://github.com/yumoldianne/dsci-portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20Graduate%20Admissions%20ML%20Models.ipynb) Utilizing K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forest algorithms for classification and regression tasks, this project aims to provide insights into the importance of various admission parameters such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, University Rating, and others. 
	 - üè¶ [Unsupervised Learning: Banking Dynamics with Customer Segmentation and Time Series Analysis:](https://github.com/yumoldianne/dsci-portfolio/tree/main/Custumer%20Segmentation%20and%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting%20for%20Business%20Insights) Implemented a comprehensive data science project for a bank, focusing on customer segmentation and time series forecasting to derive actionable insights for business decision-making and enhance customer satisfaction. The project encompassed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the optimization of customer segmentation through the comparison of five clustering algorithms. Additionally, it featured an intelligent application phase involving hypothesis testing using the Kruskal-Wallis test and time series forecasting via Prophet.

- ### Natural Language Processing
	 - üß† [Deep Learning: Mental Health Patterns in Pandemic Discourse Classifier:](https://github.com/yumoldianne/dsci-portfolio/tree/main/Unveiling%20Mental%20Health%20Patterns%20in%20Pandemic%20Discourse%20through%20Deep%20Learning) Designing and implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models that learn from a diverse dataset of Reddit posts related to mental health during the pandemic, the project aims to classify posts into distinct categories‚Äîsuch as anxiety, schizophrenia, and others‚Äîrevealing the challenges of distinguishing overlapping symptoms and providing insights into the language used by individuals experiencing these conditions.

	_Tools: NLTK, scikit-learn_ 

- ### Data Analysis and Visualization
	 - ü™ô [E-Commerce Sales Forecast](https://github.com/yumoldianne/dsci-portfolio/blob/main/E-Commerce%20Sales%20Forecast.ipynb): Utilized exploratory data analysis techniques to identify patterns, trends, and insights within the e-commerce dataset and applied time series forecasting techniques using Prophet to predict sales for the upcoming year. Applied K-Means clustering algorithm to categorize customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior.
	 - Air Quality Analysis in Pre- and Post-Pandemic Philippines: work in progress
 
	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly Express, scikit-learn, Prophet_ 

- ### Computer Simulations and Modeling 
	 - üí≠ [Agent-Based Modelling: Rumor Propagation Model:](https://github.com/yumoldianne/dsci-portfolio/blob/main/Rumor%20Propagation%20Model%20using%20ABM.ipynb) Conducted an agent-based modeling project to simulate and analyze the propagation of rumors in various scenarios, considering factors such as acceptance rates, introduction times, and starting locations. The results highlight the significant impact of these factors on the spread of rumor and truth, providing insights for effective intervention strategies.
